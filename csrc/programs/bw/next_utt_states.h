 * Graph-aware twin of next_utt_states.
 *
 * Composes mk_phone_graph -> phone_graph_split_contexts ->
 * cvt2triphone_graph -> state_seq_make_graph, so every pronunciation
 * variant of every word contributes a parallel path through the
 * sentence HMM. Use this when multi-pronunciation Baum-Welch is on.
 *
 * Unlike next_utt_states, the returned state_t array is freshly
 * allocated per call (not backed by static buffers inside
 * state_seq_make). The caller is responsible for releasing it with
 * state_seq_free(state_seq, *n_state) when done.
 *
 * Returns NULL on failure (transcript empty, word lookup failed,
 * context-split failed, etc.); an E_WARN/E_ERROR has already been
 * emitted in that case.
