# Task Orchestration System Design

> **Status note (2026):** the framework-comparison sections of this
> document are now historical. We rolled our own task runner instead of
> using Snakemake/Dagster/etc. See
> [`pipeline-runner.md`](pipeline-runner.md) for the current
> implementation. The architectural ideas around observability, build
> tracking, and chunk composition below are still relevant as a roadmap.

## Goals

### Primary Goals

1. **Replace Perl-based orchestration** with modern Python-based workflow management
2. **Enable parallelism** at multiple levels:
   - Per-file: Process multiple audio files concurrently
   - Per-iteration: Run multiple training iterations in parallel
   - Per-step: Execute independent pipeline stages concurrently
3. **Maintain compatibility** with existing C CLI programs while adding Python orchestration
4. **Support both sequential and independent dependencies** in training pipelines
5. **Scale from local to distributed** execution (local multi-core → GCE/cluster)

### Secondary Goals

1. **Library-first design**: All business logic in `st2.lib`, orchestration is thin wrapper
2. **JSON-serializable outputs**: All pipeline results return JSON for web/API integration
3. **Robust incremental execution**: Only rebuild what changed, skip completed work reliably
4. **Resume capability**: Restart from any point, never redo completed computation
5. **Stop and inspect**: Gracefully stop workflows, inspect current state, robustly restart
6. **Easy debugging**: Clear error messages, dry-run mode, logging
7. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new pipeline steps and workflows

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Execute C programs** (sphinx_fe, bw, norm, etc.) as pipeline steps
2. **Call Python functions** from `st2.lib` as pipeline steps
3. **Handle file dependencies**: Output of step N is input to step N+1
4. **Support batch processing**: Process multiple files with wildcards
5. **Configuration management**: YAML/JSON config files for pipeline parameters
6. **Error handling**: Retry failed steps, clear error messages
7. **Progress tracking**: Show which steps are running/completed
8. **Build tracking**: Track all builds, their status (success/failure), timestamps, and metadata
9. **Logging**: Comprehensive logging at multiple levels (debug, info, warning, error)
10. **Failure analysis**: Track what failed, why it failed, and how to fix it
11. **Incremental execution**: Robustly skip completed steps, never redo work unnecessarily
12. **Resume/restart**: Resume from any point after interruption, handle partial builds
13. **Stop workflows**: Gracefully stop running workflows (Ctrl+C, SIGTERM, CLI command)
14. **Inspect state**: Query current workflow state (what's running, what's done, what's pending)
15. **Robust restart**: Restart interrupted workflows from last checkpoint, never redo completed work
16. **Product tracking**: Track all files/products created by each step/phase
17. **Phase cleanup**: Clean out products from specific phases before restarting
18. **Output validation**: Verify outputs are valid before skipping computation
14. **Change detection**: Detect when inputs/config changed vs when they're identical
15. **Profiling and observability**: Comprehensive performance profiling, metrics, and tracing
16. **Resource monitoring**: Track CPU, memory, disk, network usage per step
17. **Performance analysis**: Identify bottlenecks, slow steps, resource constraints
18. **Ad-hoc step execution**: Run individual steps from CLI, track them separately
19. **Unified tracking**: Manual steps and pipeline steps tracked in same system
20. **Step reuse**: Pipeline can detect and reuse manually executed steps
21. **Trace inspection**: Honeycomb-style trace inspection with rich attributes and queryable spans
22. **Call chain visualization**: See complete execution flow with parent-child relationships
23. **High-cardinality data**: Rich span attributes for filtering, grouping, and analysis
24. **Reusable workflow chunks**: Modular, composable workflow components
25. **Simple and composed chunks**: Both atomic steps and multi-step workflows as reusable units
26. **Easy configuration**: Simple, declarative configuration system for defining and composing chunks

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**: Efficient parallel execution, minimal overhead
2. **Reliability**: Handle failures gracefully, resume from checkpoints
3. **Maintainability**: Clear code structure, good documentation
4. **Portability**: Works on macOS, Linux (Windows optional)
5. **Observability**: Comprehensive logging, metrics, tracing, and profiling
6. **Auditability**: Complete history of builds, changes, and outcomes
7. **Robustness**: Never redo completed work, handle interruptions gracefully
8. **Correctness**: Verify outputs are valid, detect corruption or incomplete files
9. **Performance visibility**: Detailed profiling of all operations, identify bottlenecks
10. **Resource awareness**: Track and optimize resource usage across all steps

## Design Decisions

### Framework Evaluation

**IMPORTANT:** Given our extensive requirements (concurrency, incremental execution, observability, composition, profiling, logging, build tracking), we should evaluate using an existing framework rather than building everything ourselves.

**See:** `docs/design/framework-evaluation.md` for detailed comparison.

**Top Candidates:**
1. **Dagster** - Strong asset tracking (incremental execution), excellent observability, composition
2. **Prefect 3.0** - Modern workflow orchestration, excellent observability, composition
3. **Snakemake** ⭐ **SELECTED** - Excellent for file-based workflows, but limited observability (would need to build)

**Decision:** **Snakemake** - Chosen for simplicity, quick start, and full control. Will build observability, chunks, and profiling as needed. Can migrate to Dagster later if service mode becomes critical.

**See:** `docs/design/snakemake-vs-dagster.md` for detailed decision rationale.

### Build System Choice: Snakemake (Current)

**Rationale:**
- Excellent parallelism support (`-j N` for local, cluster support for distributed)
- Automatic dependency resolution based on file inputs/outputs
- Handles both sequential and independent dependencies naturally
- Wildcards enable batch processing (process all `{sample}.wav` files)
- Scales from local to distributed (GCE via Kubernetes)
- Python-based DSL (familiar, can call Python functions)
- Widely used in scientific computing (proven for similar use cases)

**Limitations:**
- Limited observability (would need to build OpenTelemetry integration)
- No built-in chunk/composition system (would need to build)
- No built-in profiling (would need to build)
- Standalone execution would need to be built

**Alternatives Considered:**
- **Dagster**: Has asset tracking, observability, composition built-in - **EVALUATED, DEFERRED** (can migrate later if service mode needed)
- **Prefect**: Has observability, composition built-in - **EVALUATED, DEFERRED**
- **doit**: Good but less automatic dependency resolution
- **invoke**: Too manual, no built-in parallelism
- **luigi/temporal**: More complex setup, overkill for initial needs

## Chunk System Design

### Chunk Types

**1. Simple Chunks** (atomic operations):
- Single step execution
- Direct mapping to a C program or Python function
- Example: `extract_features`, `normalize`, `init_gaussians`

**2. Composed Chunks** (workflow components):
- Multiple steps or chunks combined
- Can include other composed chunks
- Example: `feature_pipeline`, `training_pipeline`, `full_training`

### Chunk Definition Format

```yaml
# chunks/extract_features.yaml
chunk:
  name: "extract_features"
  version: "1.0"
  type: "simple"  # or "composed"
  description: "Extract acoustic features from audio file"

  # For simple chunks
  step:
    program: "sphinx_fe"  # C program name
    # or
    function: "st2.lib.tasks.extract_features"  # Python function

  inputs:
    - name: "audio_file"
      type: "file"
      required: true
      description: "Input audio file (WAV format)"

  outputs:
    - name: "features_file"
      type: "file"
      description: "Output features file (MFC format)"

  parameters:
    - name: "sample_rate"
      type: "int"
      default: 16000
      description: "Audio sample rate"
    - name: "argfile"
      type: "file"
      default: "config/feat.params"
      description: "Feature extraction parameter file"

  config:
    sphinx_fe:
      argfile: "config/feat.params"
      output_format: "mfc"
```

```yaml
# chunks/feature_pipeline.yaml
chunk:
  name: "feature_pipeline"
  version: "1.0"
  type: "composed"
  description: "Complete feature extraction and normalization pipeline"

  # Composed from other chunks
  steps:
    - chunk: "extract_features"
      inputs:
        audio_file: "{audio_file}"
      outputs:
        features_file: "{workdir}/features.mfc"
      parameters:
        sample_rate: "{sample_rate}"

    - chunk: "normalize"
      inputs:
        input_file: "{workdir}/features.mfc"
      outputs:
        output_file: "{workdir}/features.norm"
      parameters:
        method: "{normalization_method}"

  inputs:
    - name: "audio_file"
      type: "file"
      required: true

  outputs:
    - name: "normalized_features"
      type: "file"
      description: "Normalized feature file"

  parameters:
    - name: "sample_rate"
      type: "int"
      default: 16000
    - name: "normalization_method"
      type: "string"
      default: "cmn"
    - name: "workdir"
      type: "path"
      default: "work"
```

### Workflow Configuration Using Chunks

```yaml
# workflows/basic_training/config.yaml
workflow:
  name: "basic_training"
  version: "1.0"

  # Use chunks to compose workflow
  chunks:
    - name: "feature_pipeline"
      inputs:
        audio_file: "data/{sample}.wav"
      outputs:
        normalized_features: "work/{sample}.norm"
      parameters:
        sample_rate: 16000
        normalization_method: "cmn"

    - name: "init_gaussians"
      inputs:
        features: "work/{sample}.norm"
      outputs:
        gaussians: "models/{sample}.gau"
      parameters:
        n_gaussians: 256

    - name: "train_bw"
      inputs:
        features: "work/{sample}.norm"
        gaussians: "models/{sample}.gau"
      outputs:
        model: "models/{sample}.mdef"
      parameters:
        iterations: 5
        argfile: "config/bw.params"

data:
  samples: ["sample1", "sample2"]  # or use wildcards
  workdir: "work"
  output_dir: "models"

parallelism:
  max_workers: 4
  per_file: true
```

### Chunk Registry Structure

```

## Configuration Schema (Draft)

```yaml
# config.yaml
workflow:
  name: "basic_training"
  version: "1.0"

data:
  audio_dir: "data/audio"
  output_dir: "output"
  samples: ["sample1", "sample2"]  # or use wildcards

features:
  sphinx_fe:
    argfile: "config/feat.params"
    output_format: "mfc"

training:
  iterations: 5
  bw:
    argfile: "config/bw.params"
  init_gau:
    argfile: "config/init_gau.params"

parallelism:
  max_workers: 4
  per_file: true
  per_iteration: false  # Set to true for parallel iterations
```

### Logging Architecture

**Log Levels:**
- `DEBUG`: Detailed diagnostic information
- `INFO`: General informational messages
- `WARNING`: Warning messages (non-fatal issues)
- `ERROR`: Error messages (step failures)
- `CRITICAL`: Critical errors (build failures)

**Log Outputs:**
1. **Console**: Human-readable, colored output
2. **Build log**: Single file per build with all steps
3. **Step logs**: Individual log files per step
4. **Structured logs**: JSON format for parsing/analysis

**Log Format:**
```
[2025-01-12 15:30:45.123] [INFO] [build:abc123] [step:extract_features] Starting feature extraction
[2025-01-12 15:30:45.456] [DEBUG] [build:abc123] [step:extract_features] Command: sphinx_fe -i input.wav -o output.mfc
[2025-01-12 15:30:47.789] [INFO] [build:abc123] [step:extract_features] Completed successfully (2.3s)
```

**Structured JSON Format:**
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-01-12T15:30:45.123Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "build_id": "abc123",
  "step_name": "extract_features",
  "message": "Starting feature extraction",
  "metadata": {
    "input_file": "input.wav",
    "output_file": "output.mfc"
  }
}
```

### Failure Analysis

**Failure Categories:**
1. **Timeout**: Step exceeded time limit
2. **Exit code**: C program returned non-zero
3. **Exception**: Python exception raised
4. **Missing dependency**: Required input file missing
5. **Resource error**: Out of memory, disk full, etc.
6. **Configuration error**: Invalid config parameters

**Failure Reporting:**
- Error message with context
- Stack trace (for Python errors)
- Command that failed (for C programs)
- Input/output files involved
- Suggested fixes based on error type

## Incremental Execution Strategy

### Principles

1. **Never redo completed work**: If a step completed successfully and inputs haven't changed, skip it
2. **Validate before skipping**: Always verify outputs are valid before assuming work is done
3. **Resume from last checkpoint**: On restart, continue from last successful step, not from beginning
4. **Detect changes robustly**: Use checksums, not just timestamps, to detect real changes
5. **Handle interruptions gracefully**: Partial builds should be resumable, not restarted

### Implementation Approach

**1. File State Tracking**
- Store checksums (SHA256) of all input and output files
- Compare current file state vs last successful build
- Only rebuild if:
  - Input file checksum changed
  - Output file missing or invalid
  - Config file changed
  - Step code changed (for Python functions)

**2. Output Validation**
- Check file exists and is non-empty
- Verify file format (magic numbers, headers)
- Store checksum of output for future comparison
- Mark step as "validated" only after all checks pass

**3. Snakemake Integration**
- Use Snakemake's built-in file-based dependency tracking
- Enhance with checksum-based change detection
- Use Snakemake's `checkpoint` feature for resume points
- Integrate with build tracker for state persistence

**4. Resume Logic**
```python
def should_skip_step(step_name, inputs, outputs, config_hash):
    """Determine if step can be skipped.

    Checks both pipeline-executed steps and standalone CLI-executed steps.
    """
    # Check if step completed successfully before (pipeline or standalone)
    last_step = get_last_step(step_name, config_hash, execution_type=None)
    if not last_step:
        return False  # Never run before

    # Check if inputs changed
    for input_file in inputs:
        current_checksum = compute_checksum(input_file)
        if current_checksum != last_step.input_checksums.get(input_file):
            return False  # Input changed

    # Check if outputs are valid
    for output_file in outputs:
        if not file_exists(output_file):
            return False  # Output missing
        if not validate_output(output_file):
            return False  # Output invalid
        current_checksum = compute_checksum(output_file)
        if current_checksum != last_step.output_checksums.get(output_file):
            return False  # Output changed (corrupted?)

    return True  # All checks passed, can skip
```

**5. Unified Step Execution**
- Steps can be executed:
  - As part of a pipeline (via Snakemake)
  - Standalone from CLI (`st2 step <step-name>`)
- Both execution types tracked in same database
- Pipeline can detect and reuse standalone-executed steps
- Standalone steps create their own "build" record for tracking

**6. Checkpoint System**
- After each step completes, save checkpoint
- On restart, load last checkpoint
- Resume from checkpoint, not from beginning
- Handle partial outputs (clean up incomplete files)
- Checkpoints work for both pipeline and standalone steps

## Implementation Decisions

### Resolved Decisions

1. **C program integration**: Start with subprocess, optimize to C bindings if needed
   - **Decision:** Use `subprocess.run()` initially, can add CFFI later
   - **Status:** ✅ Decided

2. **Config format**: YAML for config files, JSON for API responses
   - **Decision:** Use `pyyaml` for parsing
   - **Status:** ✅ Decided

3. **Workflow versioning**: Semantic versioning in config file, tracked in build tracker
   - **Decision:** `version: "1.0.0"` in workflow config
   - **Status:** ✅ Decided

4. **State management**: Snakemake handles file dependencies, we add checksum validation
   - **Decision:** Use Snakemake's file tracking + our checksum validation
   - **Status:** ✅ Decided

5. **Build storage**: SQLite for now, can migrate to PostgreSQL later
   - **Decision:** SQLite database in `st2/builds/builds.db`
   - **Status:** ✅ Decided

6. **Log retention**: Configurable retention policy
   - **Decision:** Keep last N builds, archive older ones
   - **Status:** ✅ Decided

7. **Checksum algorithm**: SHA256 for correctness, cache checksums
   - **Decision:** Default SHA256, allow MD5 for large files
   - **Status:** ✅ Decided

8. **Validation strategy**: Quick checks by default, full validation optional
   - **Decision:** `validate_outputs: true` config option
   - **Status:** ✅ Decided

9. **OpenTelemetry setup**: Local file export initially, OTLP for production
   - **Decision:** File-based traces for local analysis, optional OTLP for distributed
   - **Status:** ✅ Decided

10. **Profiling overhead**: Full profiling by default (can disable for production)
    - **Decision:** Config option `profiling_enabled: true`
    - **Status:** ✅ Decided

11. **Metrics storage**: Store in SQLite, export capability for external systems
    - **Decision:** SQLite for now, export functions for Prometheus/InfluxDB
    - **Status:** ✅ Decided

12. **Step execution model**: Unified tracking with execution_type field
    - **Decision:** Standalone steps create their own build record, pipeline can reference them
    - **Status:** ✅ Decided

13. **Trace inspection tool**: Support both - export to Honeycomb, local query interface
    - **Decision:** OTLP export to Honeycomb, local SQLite for querying
    - **Status:** ✅ Decided

14. **Chunk system design**: YAML for configuration, Python for complex logic
    - **Decision:** YAML definitions with Python validation and execution
    - **Status:** ✅ Decided

15. **Chunk composition**: Template-based with variable substitution
    - **Decision:** Jinja2-style templates in YAML configs
    - **Status:** ✅ Decided

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Framework Decision: Snakemake**
   - Decision made: Use Snakemake for orchestration
   - Will build observability, chunks, and profiling as needed
   - Can migrate to Dagster later if service mode becomes critical
   - See `docs/design/snakemake-vs-dagster.md` for decision rationale

2. **Start with Phase 1 (Foundation)**
   - Implement TODO 1.1 (Snakemake infrastructure)
   - Set up basic workflow structure
   - Create initial task wrappers

3. **Iterate based on feedback**

## Observability Architecture

### OpenTelemetry Integration (Honeycomb-style)

**Components:**
1. **Tracing**: Track execution flow with rich attributes for inspection
2. **Metrics**: Collect performance and resource metrics
3. **Logging**: Structured logs with trace correlation

**Implementation:**

```python
# st2/lib/observability.py
from opentelemetry import trace
from opentelemetry import metrics
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import BatchSpanProcessor
from opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.grpc.trace_exporter import OTLPSpanExporter
from opentelemetry.sdk.metrics import MeterProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.resources import Resource

# Setup with rich resource attributes
resource = Resource.create({
    "service.name": "st2",
    "service.version": __version__,
    "deployment.environment": os.getenv("ENV", "development"),
})

trace.set_tracer_provider(TracerProvider(resource=resource))
metrics.set_meter_provider(MeterProvider(resource=resource))

# Exporters (Honeycomb via OTLP, or local file)
honeycomb_exporter = OTLPSpanExporter(
    endpoint="https://api.honeycomb.io",
    headers={"x-honeycomb-team": os.getenv("HONEYCOMB_API_KEY")}
)
trace.get_tracer_provider().add_span_processor(
    BatchSpanProcessor(honeycomb_exporter)
)

# Usage in tasks with rich attributes
tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)
meter = metrics.get_meter(__name__)

def extract_features(input_file, output_file, config):
    with tracer.start_as_current_span(
        "extract_features",
        attributes={
            # High-cardinality attributes for filtering
            "step.name": "extract_features",
            "step.type": "feature_extraction",
            "input.file": str(input_file),
            "output.file": str(output_file),
            "input.size_bytes": input_file.stat().st_size,
            "config.sample_rate": config.get("sample_rate"),
            "config.window_size": config.get("window_size"),
        }
    ) as span:
        # Track sub-operations
        with tracer.start_as_current_span(
            "sphinx_fe_execution",
            attributes={
                "program": "sphinx_fe",
                "command": f"sphinx_fe -i {input_file} -o {output_file}",
            }
        ):
            result = run_sphinx_fe(input_file, output_file)

        # Add result attributes
        span.set_attribute("output.size_bytes", output_file.stat().st_size)
        span.set_attribute("duration_seconds", result.duration)
        span.set_attribute("success", result.success)

        # Add event for milestone
        span.add_event("feature_extraction_complete", {
            "features_extracted": result.feature_count,
        })

        return result
```

**Trace Structure with Rich Attributes:**
```
build:abc123 (span)
  attributes: {
    build_id: "abc123",
    workflow_name: "basic_training",

**Query Examples (Honeycomb-style):**
```python
# Query all failed steps
WHERE step.status = "failed"

# Find slow steps
WHERE step.duration_seconds > 10
GROUP BY step.name
ORDER BY avg(duration_seconds) DESC

# Compare builds
WHERE build_id IN ("abc123", "def456")
GROUP BY build_id, step.name
SELECT avg(duration_seconds), p95(duration_seconds)

# Find memory issues
WHERE step.memory_peak_mb > 1000
AND step.status = "failed"

# Trace call chain for a specific build
WHERE build_id = "abc123"
ORDER BY span.start_time
```

**Metrics Collected:**
- `build.duration` - Total build time
- `step.duration` - Per-step duration
- `step.cpu_time` - CPU time per step
- `step.memory_peak` - Peak memory usage
- `step.disk_io` - Disk I/O bytes
- `build.success_rate` - Success/failure rate
- `step.retry_count` - Number of retries
- All metrics include high-cardinality attributes for filtering

**Profiling Integration:**
- cProfile for CPU profiling
- tracemalloc for memory profiling
- Custom I/O profiler for file operations
- Per-step profiling data stored in build tracker
