"""Compare which pronunciation variants PocketSphinx alignment picks
when running against two acoustic models trained on the same data:
one with `multipron_training=True` (the default) and one with it
turned off.

For each test utterance we run forced alignment with both models via
the raw PocketSphinx `Decoder` (single-pass word-level via `seg()`).
Each segment's `.word` carries the variant suffix where applicable
(e.g. `reading(2)`). A difference at the same word index means the
two models disagree about which variant won the Viterbi search.

Usage:
  python scripts/compare_multipron_alignments.py MULTIPRON_MODEL_DIR LINEAR_MODEL_DIR

How to produce the two model dirs (cd-1g example):

  # 1. Build with multipron=True (the default)
  st2 build cd-1g -j 4
  cp -r shared/models/cd-1g/default /tmp/cd-1g.multipron

  # 2. Set multipron_training=false in etc/configs.yaml, wipe affected
  #    model dirs, rebuild
  rm -rf shared/models/ci-1g shared/models/cd-*
  st2 build cd-1g -j 4
  cp -r shared/models/cd-1g/default /tmp/cd-1g.linear

  # 3. Restore configs.yaml and run the comparison
  python scripts/compare_multipron_alignments.py /tmp/cd-1g.multipron /tmp/cd-1g.linear
