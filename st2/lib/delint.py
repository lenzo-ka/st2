"""Deleted interpolation for mixture weight smoothing.

This module provides CFFI-based wrappers for deleted interpolation, which
smooths context-dependent mixture weights by interpolating between CD, CI,
and uniform distributions using held-out data.

Example usage:
    from st2.lib.delint import deleted_interpolation

    # Smooth mixture weights
    deleted_interpolation(
        mdef_path="model/mdef",
        output_path="model/mixw_smoothed",
        accum_dirs=["bwaccum/part1", "bwaccum/part2"],
        ci_lambda=0.9
    )

    """Perform deleted interpolation to smooth mixture weights.

    Deleted interpolation is an EM-style algorithm that interpolates between:
    - Context-dependent (CD) distributions
    - Context-independent (CI) distributions
    - Uniform distributions

    The interpolation weights are estimated from held-out data to prevent
    overfitting, especially for rarely-seen triphones.

    Args:
        mdef_path: Path to model definition file
        output_path: Path to write smoothed mixture weights
        accum_dirs: List of accumulator directories from BW training.
                    Must be an even number (for cross-validation).
        ci_lambda: CI interpolation weight (0.0-1.0, default 0.9)
        max_iter: Maximum iterations for convergence (default 100)

    Returns:
        0 on success, non-zero on error

    Raises:
        ValueError: If fewer than 2 accumulator directories specified
        RuntimeError: If the C library call fails

    Note:
        This is typically the final step in semi-continuous model training.
        For continuous models, mixture weight smoothing is usually not needed.

        The accumulator directories must contain mixw_counts files from
        separate partitions of the training data.
