"""Phoneset handling and phone mapping utilities.

A Phoneset defines the inventory of valid phones in an acoustic model.
Phone mapping functions convert between different phonetic representations.

Phone Mapping
-------------
Maps can be loaded from JSON or text files:

JSON format:
    {"AA": "ɑ", "AE": "æ", "_description": "ignored"}

Text format (-> delimiter):
    AA -> ɑ
    AE -> æ
    # Comments start with #

Mapping types:
- One-to-one: "AA" -> "ɑ" (simple substitution)
- Expansion: "CH" -> "t ʃ" (one phone expands to sequence, space-separated)
- Deletion: "X" -> "" (phone removed from output)

Mappings are directional (A -> B does not imply B -> A). For bidirectional
conversion, provide separate forward and reverse mapping files.

Note: True one-to-many (ambiguous) mappings where one source has multiple
possible targets are not supported. Each source phone maps to exactly one
target (which may be a sequence or empty).

Stress Removal via Maps
-----------------------
ARPABET stress can be stripped using a map:
    AA0 -> AA
    AA1 -> AA
    AA2 -> AA
    ...

This is more general than regex-based stripping and works with
any phoneset that uses numeric suffixes for stress/tone.
